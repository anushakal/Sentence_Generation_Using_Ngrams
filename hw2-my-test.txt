<s> As a food blogger, consistently publishing quality content that connects with your readers and at the same time serves your blogs monetary goals is a challenge </s>
<s> The most common bottleneck is not having enough ideas for blog posts </s>
<s> If you’ve found yourself wondering what you should be writing about next, you arent alone </s>
<s> Even the pro food bloggers struggle to serve delicious, relevant content on their food blogs </s>
<s> Think of this as a sort of writers block </s>
<s> One of the best ways to beat this block and warm up to writing is to look at successful food blog writing examples from other websites </s>
<s> To give you a head start, were rounding up some excellent food blog writing examples in this article that you can recreate on your blog </s>
<s> We’ll also go over a few key steps to help you use these samples in a way that aligns with your target audience’s taste and your growth goals </s>
<s>You dont need to change the oven temperature </s>
<s> The OG recipe calls for baking the feta with the tomatoes at 400° for 30 minutes then kicking up for the last 10 minutes </s>
<s> After 30 minutes in the oven, I found my feta well on its way to a pretty shade of golden on top </s>
<s> To avoid burning additions like garlic and herbs (see my next note), I think its best to keep the temperature steady </s>
<s> You can play add more than just tomatoes and feta </s>
<s> Quartered shallots will get nice and jammy, and smashed garlic will infuse the olive oil </s>
<s> Like spice? Throw in a ton of crushed red pepper flakes </s>
<s> Got thyme? Add a couple sprigs for an earthy touch </s>
<s> Adding pasta water helps </s>
<s> A scoop of pasta water will help stretch your sauce to coat your pasta more smoothly and generously </s>
<s>Preheat oven to 400° </s>
<s> In a large ovenproof skillet or medium baking dish, combine tomatoes, shallot, garlic, and all but 1 tablespoon oil </s>
<s> Season with salt and red pepper flakes and toss to combine </s>
<s> Place feta into center of tomato mixture and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil </s>
<s> Scatter thyme sprigs over tomatoes </s>
<s> Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until tomatoes are bursting and feta is golden on top </s>
<s> Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente according to package directions </s>
<s> Reserve ½ cup pasta water before draining </s>
<s> To skillet with tomatoes and feta, add cooked pasta, reserved pasta water, and lemon zest (if using) and stir until combined </s>
<s> Garnish with basil </s>
<s>We write about Oreos a lot here </s>
<s> Like, a lot a lot </s>
<s> But can you blame us? The classic cookie has been around longer than any of us have (since 1912!), and there are so many Oreo recipes and desserts out there that frankly, were surprised that we as a society haven’t caused a nationwide shortage </s>
<s> There are few things in the world more simple and versatile as an Oreo cookie and milk (yes, that includes all of the 85-plus flavors in the brands history), and its safe to say were just a little bit obsessed </s>
<s> Case in point, this giant Oreo cake, these Oreo truffles, this Oreo popcorn, and this Oreo cookie skillet </s>
<s> You get the idea </s>
<s> It was only a matter of time before we turned around and said, “Have we ever tried them all in one sitting We hadnt </s>
<s> So we did </s>
<s>Of course, there were hiccups </s>
<s> Although so many Oreo flavors have emerged over the course of the cookie brands 110-year lifespan, some flavors are hard to find on shelves </s>
<s> Some seem to be discontinued </s>
<s> Others are only available overseas </s>
<s> Green tea Oreos, for instance, are only available in Japan </s>
